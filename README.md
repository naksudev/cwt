# Change Wallpaper Theme (cwt)
A tool to manage wallpaper themes using [swww](https://github.com/LGFae/swww)

## Important
DO NOT USE THIS. I made this to learn Rust and it doesn't work as intended.
Swww offers scripts that does pretty much the same thing as this tool: https://github.com/LGFae/swww/tree/main/example_scripts
